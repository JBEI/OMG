# OMG: Omics Mock Generator

Generates a mock dataset of _omics_ data (importable in EDD using the new import format): transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

### Dependencies
- pip
- Python 3.8
- cobra
- pandas
- [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio?)


### Package Installation

Please follow the next steps after cloning the repository:
```bash
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install
```
You may want to use the `--user` flag in `pip` and prepend `~/.local/bin` to your path.

### Jupyter Notebook

An example Jupyter Notebook, using the OMG module, is included here. To run,
build the Docker image, and run it to access a Jupyter Lab server:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t omg .
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" omg
```

After the server launches, the terminal will have instructions on how to open
the Jupyter Lab server from your browser, looking something like the below:

```
    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-8-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://<container_id>:8888/lab?token=<random token value>
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<random token value>
```

Copy the last URL and open in a web browser. The notebook `example.ipynb` will
be in the `work` folder. Run the example as-is, or make modifications to cells
in the notebook or uploaded input files.
